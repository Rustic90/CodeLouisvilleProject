Hello and thank you for checking out my project. This is a front-end only project, 
so no live servers are required for viewing. The only thing you need to do for full
functionality is view this project using a browser that has javascript enabled and 
supports local storage and canvas. 

*Please begin on index.html and progress as you like.*
Here is a brief summary of each part of the project, enjoy!

-------------------
Landing Page(index)
-------------------
Simple landing page designed to invite the user to enter the website. 

---------
Home Page
---------
Page that shows the amount of time until each major holiday. Will 
display time remaining until 2020 or 2021 holiday based on if the holiday has
happened yet this year. 

? Mark tooltips are available to produce a modal with additional information.
To leave the modal, click anywhere outside of it.

--------------
Personal Dates
--------------
Allows the user to create up to 3 specific dates custom to the user. Equipped 
with primitive input validation, the completed form will display the holiday name
and days until the holiday. Created dates are saved into local storage and will 
be remembered for future visits to the page. Dates can be cleared out and new ones
created.

-------------
Holiday Games
-------------
The current version of this page displays a hangman game on arrival. The user has to 
choose letters to complete the random word based on the holiday given. If the letter is 
not in the generated word, the normal hangman picture will be drawn on the html canvas
element. An alert will appear when you win or lose.

-------
Contact
-------
A simple contact form for suggestions to improve the site. Comes with form validation
that will place a red border around any empty fields upon submission. As this project is 
front-end only, this form does not actually submit to any back-end code. Upon successful
completion of all fields and clicking the submit button, an alert appears saying form 
submitted successfully. Clear button is included to reset form data quickly.
