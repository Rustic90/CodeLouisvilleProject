Hello and thank you for checking out my project. Most of this is front-end only and will work without a server.
As of right now, the only thing requiring a server is the survey. To get the survey to work properly, a MySQL database 
is needed with a database named holidaycelebration, a table named holiday-survey, and two columns named holiday and votes.

Enjoy!
